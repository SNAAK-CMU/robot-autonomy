\section{INTRODUCTION}

At home, especially while cooking, there are many situations when pouring an accurate amount of a substance is needed. For example, pouring the correct weight of a spice into a bowl for mixing, or pouring pieces of candy out of a jar. While these tasks are relatively simple for a human, they present a significant challenge to be automated by robotics. In particular, there are a number of actions that humans perform, such as shaking a container, or oscillating the pitch of the container, that are difficult for a robot to replicate.
Our project aims to pour beads to serve as a baseline solution to the pouring problem. Specifically, the aim of this project is to accurately pour a specified weight of beads into a container or cup. Beads are ideal, as they avoid friction issues that can arise when pouring powders or other irregular shaped objects. However, pouring beads accurately still requires a fine level of control of the pitch of the container bottle. Additionally, prediction of the trajectory of the poured beads must be done to land them into a cup or other container reliably. 
Our approach makes use of a Franka Emika Panda robotic arm and end effector, integrated with a custom-made gripper to hold onto the bead bottle. We also make use of an arm-mounted camera and a digital, high-precision weighing scale. The camera captures the location of the cup or container that will catch the beads, and the weighing scale provides a feedback mechanism to provide information on the weight of beads that remain to be poured. This feedback, coupled with modeling the dynamics of beads in flight and adjusting accordingly, will provide a mechanism to pour a desired weight of beads accurately and spill-free.

\section{RELATED WORK}

\subsection{Header 1}

First, confirm that you have the correct template for your paper size. This template has been tailored for output on the US-letter paper size. 
It may be used for A4 paper size if the paper size setting is suitably modified.

\subsection{Header 2}

The template is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin in this template measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. Please do not revise any of the current designations

\section{METHODOLOGY}

Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a separate text file. Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been formatted and styled. Do not use hard tabs, and limit use of hard returns to only one return at the end of a paragraph. Do not add any kind of pagination anywhere in the paper. Do not number text heads-the template will do that for you.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{sample_image2.png}
    \caption{Figure that is placed exactly at specified location, by using [H]}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

Finally, complete content and organizational editing before formatting. Please take note of the following items when proofreading spelling and grammar:

\subsection{Header 1} Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, sc, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Header 2}

\begin{itemize}

\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as Ò3.5-inch disk driveÓ.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ÒWb/m2Ó or Òwebers per square meterÓ, not Òwebers/m2Ó.  Spell out units when they appear in text: Ò. . . a few henriesÓ, not Ò. . . a few HÓ.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: Ò0.25Ó, not Ò.25Ó. Use Òcm3Ó, not ÒccÓ. (bullet list)

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Header 3}

Some examples of equations:

\begin{align}
a = b^p + \chi \\
x = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 & 9
\end{bmatrix}
or
\begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 & 9
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}

Equations aligned:

\begin{align}
    c &= ax + by \\
    \text{robot} &= \text{arm} + \text{autonomy}
\end{align}

Equations no numbering: 

\begin{align*}
    x^2 + x = \pi \\
    \underbrace{x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 -4ac}}{2a}}_{\text{quadratic equation}}
\end{align*}


Example of an Algorithm:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{An algorithm with caption}\label{alg:cap}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Require $n \geq 0$
\Ensure $y = x^n$
\State $y \gets 1$
\State $X \gets x$
\State $N \gets n$
\While{$N \neq 0$}
\If{$N$ is even}
    \State $X \gets X \times X$
    \State $N \gets \frac{N}{2}$  \Comment{This is a comment}
\ElsIf{$N$ is odd}
    \State $y \gets y \times X$
    \State $N \gets N - 1$
\EndIf
\EndWhile
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Header 4}
\begin{itemize}

\item The word ÒdataÓ is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum ?0, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ÒoÓ.
\item In American English, commas, semi-/colons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ÒinsetÓ, not an ÒinsertÓ. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ÒalternatelyÓ (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ÒessentiallyÓ to mean ÒapproximatelyÓ or ÒeffectivelyÓ.
\item In your paper title, if the words Òthat usesÓ can accurately replace the word ÒusingÓ, capitalize the ÒuÓ; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ÒaffectÓ and ÒeffectÓ, ÒcomplementÓ and ÒcomplimentÓ, ÒdiscreetÓ and ÒdiscreteÓ, ÒprincipalÓ and ÒprincipleÓ.
\item Do not confuse ÒimplyÓ and ÒinferÓ.
\item The prefix ÒnonÓ is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ÒetÓ in the Latin abbreviation Òet al.Ó.
\item The abbreviation Òi.e.Ó means Òthat isÓ, and the abbreviation Òe.g.Ó means Òfor exampleÓ.

\end{itemize}


\section{EVALUATION}

Use this sample document as your LaTeX source file to create your document. Save this file as {\bf root.tex}. You have to make sure to use the cls file that came with this distribution. If you use a different style file, you cannot expect to get required margins. Note also that when you are creating your out PDF file, the source file is only part of the equation. {\it Your \TeX\ $\rightarrow$ PDF filter determines the output file size. Even if you make all the specifications to output a letter file in the source - if your filter is set to produce A4, you will only get A4 output. }

It is impossible to account for all possible situation, one would encounter using \TeX. If you are using multiple \TeX\ files you must make sure that the ``MAIN`` source file is called root.tex - this is particularly important if your conference is using PaperPlaza's built in \TeX\ to PDF conversion tool.

\subsection{Headings 1}

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads should be introduced. Styles named ÒHeading 1Ó, ÒHeading 2Ó, ÒHeading 3Ó, and ÒHeading 4Ó are prescribed.

\subsection{Heading 2}

Positioning Figures and Tables: Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation ÒFig. 1Ó, even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{An Example of a Table}

\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}

Three & Four\\

\section{CONCLUSION}

Do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A conclusion elaborates on the importance of the work or suggest applications and extensions. 

\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
